# Magnon Webcomponents
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/MagnonGames/magnon-components.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/MagnonGames/magnon-components)

Magnon Webcomponents is a collection of webcomponents made for Magnon web projects. They're built with HTML imports, custom elements, shadow dom and CSS custom properties (also commonly known as CSS variables).

## Components

Among the different components, some highlights are:
- `magnon-logo` for a modular and animatable Magnon logo
- `magnon-image` for an &lt;img&gt; tag with superpowers (such as going to fullscreen when clicked)
- `magnon-shell` as just a shell? xP

## Contributing

Setting everything up is fairly straight forward.
- Clone the repo
- `npm i`
- Get yourself a simple web server (I use [local-web-server from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server))
- Run your web server in the project folder
- Try some of the demos
- Run tests on all installed (and recognized) browsers with `npm test`
- ...
- Profit?

Don't forget to at least use a11ySuite to test your stuff! :D
